flutter problem 

After cloning the repo, don't cd ./flutter before running the commad.
the pwd represent the current directory where you were before cloning the repo.
The full command is:

export PATH=`pwd`/flutter/bin:$PATH

You can make life easier by adding it to your bashrc or zshrc

Move flutter to home dir

$ mv flutter ~

Add the path to your ~/.zshrc
path+=('/home/username/flutter/bin')
export PATH
Source it source ~/.zshrc

>>  export PATH=`pwd`/flutter/bin:$PATH
>> pwd
>>echo $PATH
>> mv flutter ~
~$ nano ~/.zshrc [ path+=('/home/username/flutter/bin') ]
>> export PATH
source ~/.zshrc
